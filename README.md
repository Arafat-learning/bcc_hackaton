#### Introduction
This is my solution to the case provided by Bank Center Credit. They asked to build a personolized notification to client based on their behaivor.  

This repository consist of the following:
* **data**: This folder has the customer data provided by bcc. The files in this system will be used by notifier to create messages.
* **notebooks**: This folder has jupyter notebooks that I used to draft the projects
* **notifier**: Main logic of my project is implemented in this folder. It takes the datafile in data directory as input and processes it. It outputs .json file that can be used by main app to send notifications. Thus this project can be easily integrated into already existing systems.
* **ТЗ - Кейс 1.docx File** This file has the description of the task of the Bank Center Credit. Bank Center Credit is the author of this file and all the credit is due to them. I added it for ease of reference.
